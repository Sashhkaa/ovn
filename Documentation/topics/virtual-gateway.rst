Virtual Gateway
================

A *virtual gateway* is a group of two or more physical nodes that present
themselves to OVN as a single chassis. Every node of the group runs its own
``ovn-controller``, but all of them are configured with the same chassis name
(``external_ids:system-id``) and with the same encapsulation IP
(``external_ids:ovn-encap-ip``). The encapsulation IP is an anycast address,
it is announced into the underlay (statically or by a routing protocol) by all
the nodes of the group, and the underlay load-balances the tunnel traffic
between them with ECMP.

From the point of view of the OVN databases there is a single chassis: a single
``Chassis`` record, a single ``Encap`` record, and a single binding for every
port that is placed on the virtual gateway (for example the chassisredirect
port of a distributed gateway port). ``ovn-northd`` and the other
``ovn-controller`` instances do not know, and do not need to know, how many
physical nodes are behind that chassis. A hypervisor keeps a single tunnel to
the anycast encapsulation IP, and the underlay decides which node of the group
terminates a given flow.

There is no coordination and no leader election between the nodes of the
group while writing to SBDB: every ``ovn-controller`` independently does the
full bookkeeping for that one chassis, and it is the idempotence of those
writes that keeps them from fighting each other.
Two consequences follow from this.  The columns that OVN derives from the
local node rather than from the configuration must be forced to the same value
on every node, More detailed information on this is provided in the
``Identical OVS and OVN configuration and features`` section below.

Use case
--------
This is useful when the capacity or the availability of a single gateway node
is not enough: the group scales horizontally, and losing one node only means
that the underlay stops using one of the ECMP nexthops, without any change in
the OVN databases and without the gateway having to be rescheduled to another
chassis.

A typical deployment looks as follows:

* Two (or more) gateway nodes are installed with the same OVN and OVS
  versions and with an identical ``ovn-controller`` configuration. Each of
  them configures the anycast encapsulation IP locally, e.g. on the loopback
  interface, so that the kernel accepts the tunnel packets destined to it::

      $ ovs-vsctl set open . external-ids:system-id=vgw
      $ ovs-vsctl set open . external-ids:ovn-encap-ip=10.0.0.1
      $ ovs-vsctl set open . external-ids:ovn-encap-type=geneve
      $ ip address add 10.0.0.1/32 dev lo

* The anycast address is reachable in the underlay through the physical
  addresses of all the nodes of the group. On the hypervisors, and on any
  other node that has to reach the virtual gateway, this is an ECMP route::

      $ ip route replace 10.0.0.1/32 \
            nexthop via 192.168.0.1 dev eth0 \
            nexthop via 192.168.0.2 dev eth0

  In a real deployment the route is normally learned from the fabric, with the
  gateway nodes advertising the anycast prefix over BGP.

* The logical topology is configured as usual, referring to the chassis by its
  single name, e.g.::

      $ ovn-nbctl lrp-set-gateway-chassis lr0-public vgw 10

Requirements and restrictions
-----------------------------

The nodes of a virtual gateway are not independent chassis, they are one
chassis that happens to run on several machines. Everything that OVN stores
per chassis is therefore shared, and everything that OVN computes per chassis
must produce the same result on every node of the group. This leads to the
following requirements.

Identical OVS and OVN configuration and features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All the nodes of the group must run the same OVS and OVN versions and must
expose the same set of features. ``ovn-controller`` reports the capabilities
of the local OVS instance in the ``Chassis`` record (``other_config``, for
example the supported datapath interface types, and the various
``ovn-chassis-feature`` entries), and ``ovn-northd`` generates the logical
flows for the chassis based on those values. If the nodes disagree, the
``Chassis`` record will keep flapping between the values reported by each node,
``ovn-northd`` will keep recomputing, and the node whose capabilities do not
match the ones currently published may not be able to process the flows it
receives.

For the same reason, every chassis scoped configuration option has to be
identical on all the nodes, including , for example: ``external_ids:hostname``,
``external_ids:ovn-bridge-mappings`` and all others.

Only stateless traffic is supported
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The nodes of a virtual gateway do not share any runtime state, and in
particular they do not share conntrack. The underlay picks one of them per
flow, and nothing guarantees that the two directions of a connection, or the
packets of a connection before and after a change of the ECMP nexthops (a node
being added, removed, rebooted or simply an ECMP rehash), are handled by the
same node. Any feature that needs the connection state to be on the node that
processes the packet is therefore not supported on a virtual gateway:

* load balancers,
* stateful NAT, that is ``snat`` and ``dnat_and_snat`` (unless configured as
  stateless), and NAT with ``ct-commit-all`` enabled,
* stateful ACLs, and anything else that relies on conntrack, for example
  load balancer hairpinning or ECMP routes with
  ``options:ecmp_symmetric_reply`` set.

Only stateless forwarding, e.g. plain routing and switching, stateless NAT and
stateless ACLs, behaves correctly, because every packet can be handled
independently by any node of the group.

Example
-------

The ``ovn multinode virtual gateway - anycast encap ip with underlay ECMP``
test in ``tests/multinode.at`` sets up a complete example of a two node
virtual gateway with an underlay ECMP route to the anycast encapsulation IP,
a hypervisor with a VM behind the gateway and an external node that does not
run OVN at all.
